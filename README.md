Client side notes. Improvements:
1. Better UI than just alert();
2. Better testing infrastructure rather than a button to run tests.
3. Need better handling of JSON data, events are bad and so are inline naming of elements. I assume react fixes this.
4. Client side validation of input for security.
5. No validation or any front end error messages if the user does some mistake.
6. Better UI in general rather than have an edit/delete button next to everything.

See server/Readme.MD for server side notes.
